# ============================================
# SCALING BEHAVIOR
# ============================================
# 1. Normal hours: 1 instance handles ~70 concurrent connections
# 2. Scale trigger: When connections > 70, new instance starts
# 3. Peak trading: Up to 3 instances for ~210 concurrent connections
# 4. Scale down: After 5min of < 50 connections per instance
# 5. WebSocket: Socket.IO connections are sticky to instances
#
# Cost estimate (Fly.io pricing):
# - Base: ~$5/month (1 instance always on)
# - Peak: ~$10-15/month (with occasional scaling)
# ============================================
